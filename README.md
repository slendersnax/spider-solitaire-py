# spider solitaire in terminal/console

An implementation of the Spider Solitaire game using Python that is played in the console.

### usage

You don't need any special Python libraries for this, just run `python spider_solitaire.py` (or the included `play-spider.sh` file if you're on Linux), which does the same thing.

### todo
- [ ] remake with OOP principles to handle decks and cards easier
- [ ] refactor a bit to clean it up
